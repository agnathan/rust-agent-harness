# rust-agent-harness

[![CI](https://github.com/agnathan/rust-agent-harness/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/agnathan/rust-agent-harness/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An AI agent harness in Rust, with a book on how to build it step by step.

This is a hands-on course for people **new to Rust**. You learn the language by growing one harness, not by a tour of the language. The design is informed by Nous Research's [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) (Python). Each chapter points at the Hermes files that solve the same problem.

## Layout

```
steps/chNN-<slug>/   finished harness at the end of that chapter (cumulative)
my-harness/          your crate; milestone tests start out failing
book/                mdBook source and social drafts
```

A step is the code as of that chapter, library plus CLI, with its tests. Later chapters are new copies under `steps/`, so chapter 1 still builds after chapter 2 exists. They share one cargo workspace at the repo root. Package names carry the chapter (`ch01-harness-core`, `ch02-harness-cli`) and the binaries are `ch01-harness` and `ch02-harness`, so two steps can be built together. The library each test imports is still `harness_core`.

`my-harness/` is where the implementation happens. `tests/ch01.rs` is the first milestone. It compiles, then panics with `not yet implemented: chapter 01` until you replace the `todo!()` stubs. Finished snapshots stay in `steps/`. There is no solutions directory.

## How to start

1. Install Rust with [rustup](https://rustup.rs). You need 1.85 or newer (`rustc --version`).
2. Add the usual components: `rustup component add rustfmt clippy`.
3. Read [Chapter 1](book/chapter-01-first-contact.md), then make the milestone fail for the right reason and replace the stubs:

   ```bash
   cargo test -p my-harness --test ch01
   ```

4. Run the finished chapter if you want to see the behavior:

   ```bash
   cargo test -p ch01-harness-core
   cargo run -p ch01-harness-cli -- --mock ask "Say hello"
   ```

`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (default `https://api.openai.com/v1`), and `HARNESS_MODEL` (default `gpt-4o-mini`) configure a real server. `--mock` uses the offline provider.

| Chapter | Step | You add |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `steps/ch01-first-contact` | one prompt, a provider trait, a mock, `ask` |

The book outline lists the later chapters. Their step crates are added when the chapters are written.

The book builds with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/): `mdbook build` in `book/` (output in `book/_build/`, not committed).

## Continuous integration

[CI](https://github.com/agnathan/rust-agent-harness/actions/workflows/ci.yml) runs on every push to `main` and on pull requests:

- `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` (warnings do not fail the build)
- `cargo test -p …` for every step, each step as its own job, on Ubuntu
- the same tests on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows for steps whose files changed ([paths-filter](https://github.com/dorny/paths-filter))
- an mdBook build of `book/`

`my-harness` milestone tests are not part of that required build. They run in [My harness](https://github.com/agnathan/rust-agent-harness/actions/workflows/my-harness.yml).

### Milestone tests across operating systems

The workflow installs `cargo-nextest` and runs `cargo nextest run -p my-harness --test chNN` (and falls back to `cargo test` if nextest is unavailable). Unimplemented chapters show as **fail**. JUnit XML is uploaded.

**Push and pull request.** A change under `my-harness/` tests the affected chapters on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows. This mode is a report: failing stubs do not fail the workflow.

**Manual run.** Actions → My harness → Run workflow.

| Input | Values |
|---|---|
| `chapters` | `all` (default), `1`, `1-2`, or `1,2` |
| `os` | `all` (default), `ubuntu`, `macos`, or `windows` |

A manual run fails if any selected chapter fails.
